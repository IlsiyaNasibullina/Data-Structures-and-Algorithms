# Sweep Line Algorithm

This repository contains my implementation of the Sweep Line Algorithm. The code also includes the QuickSort sorting algorithm and self-balanced binary search tree (Red-Black Tree).
Time complexity of the algorithm is O(nlogn).

Input format. First line of the input contains a number N (0 < N < 106). Each of the next N lines contains a description of a segment PQ, consisting
of 4 coordinates separated by spaces: xP yP xQ yQ. Coordinates are all integers (−221 ≤ x, y ≤ 221).

Output format. If there are no intersections, output NO INTERSECTIONS. Otherwise, output INTERSECTION on the first line and any two segments that intersect on the second and third
lines, using the same format as input.
